This Twine narrative is one that explores the real-life struggles of a catholic priest during the summer of 1540. The player finds themselves in an unknown grass field and they are forced to fight their way through the dangers of the time of the Tudors. They are able to make decisions that could either have them making friends with people who will change their life, or they could make the wrong decision and find themselves wandering through the scary woods at night. This story is one that not only allows a player to experience the everyday dangers of being a catholic priest in the time of the Tudors, but it also teaches them information about the Protestant Reformation as they play through the game. This game is one that allows the everyday person to learn about the rich history of our past, while also deciding what they would like to name their new friends as they travel to London. This game is full of danger, but it is danger that people have been forced to face, and that is something that this game is able to show as the narrative plays out right before the player.
